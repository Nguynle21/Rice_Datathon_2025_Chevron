Predicting Vehicle Inventory for 2025 

Description 
Which vehicles will be on the road tomorrow?  How many miles will be traveled by all of these vehicles?  To understand future demand of fuels, we need to predict how many miles people will be driving and what vehicles people will be driving.
For this challenge, we will focus on predicting vehicle population.  Vehicle population is simply an inventory of vehicles by features such as model year and type of vehicle.  Vehicle inventories are available but most of these do not give information on the current year and do not generate insights into future years.  So, we can look to data science to uncover insights and to make predictions for future years.
In this challenge, we will use data from 2019 to 2024 to predict vehicle population in 2025.  The features include model year, vehicle type, fuel type, and number of vehicles registered to the same address.
